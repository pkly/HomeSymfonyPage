# ly-page

This project is a simple Symfony 5.4 homepage that'll allow you to see your rss feeds, show a mascot, and display links to your most viewed websites.
Mostly a simple example of a website that could be ran on a home network (which I do for my convinence).

Also a PWA, to allow you to "take it anywhere", granted the rss feeds will not update and you'll be stuck with the same mascot.

Docker images are accessible and easily upgradeable.
